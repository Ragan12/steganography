brief summary: this project is all about hiding any type of secret message text in an image, where only the person who has hidden the
message in the image and other person whom the user wants to share the message knows what secret message is hidden the image.
It is highly impossible to figure out the difference between the image where no secret message is there and the same image where
message  text is hidden, it is mainly used in military, intelligence agencies, online banking and many more ways where encryption
 is needed, the way this project works is user has a image and the user wants to hide the secret message inside the image
 he will do it by changing the LSB bits of image RGB data ,and will keep a magic string so that only the user and another person 
 whom the user wants to share the secret message will know the magic string which can be anything alphabets, number or combination
 of both this part is called encoding ,when the user recives the image ,user has to enter the secret magic string to access 
 the secret message hidden by  another user .once magic string entered the output is displayed .
